# recipe_analysis
analyze recipes from epicurious.com to explore nutrition trends

Motivation:
The purpose of this project was to explore how nutrition changes from season to season, while also honing my SQL, pandas and matplotlib skills. Food and nutrition has always interested me, so I decided to use Epicurious.com's recipes to analyze how recipes of various categories stack up against each other in terms of calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, and sodium.

Project Overview:
In this project, to get data I searched kaggle and found a great nutrition dataset from Epicurious.com. My analysis toolkit included Jupyter notebook and the following Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, and sqlite3 (write SQL queries against my data set).
